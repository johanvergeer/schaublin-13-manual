\chapter{Cooling System}

The cooling system circuit is given on page \pageref{fig:cooling_system}.

The reservoir 67 is located inside the base and forms a single piece with it. When filled to the middle of the level indicator 68, it contains approximately 24 liters of liquid.

The motor-pump unit 18 is mounted outside the machine, making it easily accessible for cleaning. The liquid supply pipe passes through the frame. The nozzle of the flexible tube that delivers the lubricant to the cutter is held in a good position by a support 69 mounted on the spindle head. The valve 70 allows adjusting the liquid flow.

The pump, reservoir, as well as pipes, filters, etc., are cleaned periodically (see ANNEX-1 attached). The two plugs 71 allow draining, and the two covers 72 allow cleaning the reservoir. The liquid drainage occurs in all table positions through two flexible hoses.

When the pump cooling is not required, a bucket can be attached to the support 69.

\textbf{RECOMMENDATION:}

Experience has shown that it is \underline{preferable to use a good cutting or turning oil as a lubricant}.

Soluble oils, decomposing after prolonged use, can cause corrosive actions on the machine components.
